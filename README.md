## Open Life Science Project (OLS)
This repo contains all the drafts, links used to develop Open Life Science Community in Saudi Arabia.

### Our vision statement:

> **We want to provide a place in Saudi Arabia where newcomers and experienced peers interact, inspire each other to embed open science (research) practices and values in their workflows and provide feedback on policies, infrastructures and support services. Together working to make Open Science the norm. So we are calling out to researchers and colleagues in Saudi Arabia**

### News - Week3
- Legal Team to register the community.
- Mentioned our community in the WiDs Workshop "Collaborating on Open Data Science Projects", which was well-received. It's available [online](https://batoolmm.github.io/Collaborating-on-Open-Data-Science-Projects/).
